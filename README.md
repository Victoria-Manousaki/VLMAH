# VLMAH

This repository contains the code for the "VLMAH: Visual-Linguistic Modeling of Action History for Effective Action Anticipation"
paper of ACVR Workshop - ICCV 2023.


-------------------------------------------------


Anaconda: Use the environment.yml file to setup the environment.


------------------------------------------------

For every dataset (Meccano, Assembly101, 50Salads) you will find the code and txt files that correspond
to each of these datasets in the corresponding folders!


At the end of each main.py file you can set all the parameters for the features that you want to use.

------------------------------------------------

For each dataset, you need to download the pre-extracted features and/or images from the original websites and
put them inside each folder. 
Example: the pre-extracted features for the Meccano dataset need to get in the path "Meccano\Meccano_features"
